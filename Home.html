  <p1> 
  Welcome to my website about British politics. The purpose of this website is simply to inform any user on the current state of polotics within the UK. Each webpage has a description of each party and their policies including their stances on different issues that the country currently faces. If you have recently turned 18 and are attempting to decide which political parties stances you most agree with in order to determine which party to vote for in any upcoming election this website can help you to determine this. The parties I will discuss on this website are: The Conservatives, The Labour party, The UK Independence party and the Liberal Democrats.
